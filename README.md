## WTPRINTS: Full-Stack E-Commerce Website-https://wtf-murex-pi.vercel.app/  

**WTPRINTS** is a full-stack e-commerce platform built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)** and **Node.js with Express & MongoDB (Backend)**.  
It enables users to browse products, manage their cart, and log in securely — forming a scalable foundation for a branded clothing store.

## Features  

- **Product Catalog** – Browse and view branded clothing with descriptions and pricing  
- **Cart System** – Add, remove, and update items with persistent storage  
- **User Authentication** – Secure login and signup with encrypted passwords  
- **Database Integration** – MongoDB stores users, products, and cart data  
- **RESTful API Architecture** – Clean separation between frontend and backend  
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile  
- **CORS Enabled** – Secure communication between frontend and backend  
- *(Planned)* Payment gateway and order tracking integration

## How It Works  

### Frontend  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it provides a dynamic and responsive shopping interface.  

### Backend  
Powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, the backend manages user authentication, product data, and cart operations via REST APIs.  

### Database  
Uses **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for storing users, products, and cart details.  

### Authentication  
- User signup/login with **bcrypt** password hashing  
- Secure session or token-based authentication  
- Environment-based configuration using **dotenv**

## Tech Stack  

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)  
**Security:** bcrypt, dotenv, CORS  
**Planned Hosting:** Render / Vercel / Netlify  

---

## Requirements  

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
- Local environment or simple HTTP server (e.g., `live-server` or VS Code extension)  

---

## Security Note  

Currently designed as a prototype for demonstration. Authentication is basic and not production-ready. Security enhancements (hashed passwords, session management, HTTPS) will be implemented in the backend version.  

---

## Future Improvements  

- Integrate payment gateway (Stripe / PayPal)  
- Add order tracking and invoice generation  
- Enhance admin dashboard for product and order management  
- Improve product search and filtering functionality  
- Optimize performance and scalability for production  
- Add analytics and customer insights dashboard
